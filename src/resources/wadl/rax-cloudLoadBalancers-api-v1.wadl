                    recommends sharing Virtual IPs between your load
                    balancers. If you have at least one load balancer,
                    you may create subsequent load balancers that
                    share a single virtual IPv4 and/or a single IPv6
                    by issuing a <command>POST</command> and supplying a virtual IP ID
                    instead of a type. Additionally, this feature is
                    highly desirable if you wish to load balance both
                    an unsecured and secure protocol using one IP or
                    DNS name. For example, this method makes it
                    possible to use the same load balancing
                    configuration to support <code>HTTP</code> and

                    <para>All requests to SSL termination in the JSON
                        format require the key/certificates to be in
                        "proper" JSON format, meaning that all raw
                        line feed characters should be wrapped in a
                        newline character. So if the user pastes in

                        file, JSON will not properly handle the field.
                        The key/certificates can be wrapped in a
                        newline character in Java, for example, using
                            <code>string.replaceAll("\n",
                            "\\n")</code>. Please refer to the

                user to terminate SSL traffic at the load balancer
                layer versus at the web server layer. A user may
                choose to configure SSL Termination using a key and an
                SSL certificate or an (Intermediate) SSL
                certificate.</para>

                balancer, a secure shadow server is created that
                listens only for secure traffic on a user-specified
                port. This shadow server is only visible to and
                manageable by the system. Existing or updated
                attributes on a load balancer with SSL Termination
                will also apply to its shadow server. For example, if
                Connection Logging is enabled on an SSL load balancer,
                it will also be enabled on the shadow server and Cloud
                Files logs will contain log files for both. </para>

                    <para>All requests to SSL termination in the JSON
                        format require the key/certificates to be in
                        "proper" JSON format, meaning that all raw
                        line feed characters should be wrapped in a
                        newline character. So if the user pastes in
                        the key from a <filename>mykey.key</filename>
                        file, JSON will not properly handle the field.
                        The key/certificates can be wrapped in a
                        newline character in Java, for example, using
                            <code>string.replaceAll("\n",
                            "\\n")</code>. Please refer to the

                user to terminate SSL traffic at the load balancer
                layer versus at the web server layer. A user may
                choose to configure SSL Termination using a key and an
                SSL certificate or an (Intermediate) SSL
                certificate.</para>

                     xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"> When SSL Termination is configured on a load
                balancer, a secure shadow server is created that
                listens only for secure traffic on a user-specified
                port. This shadow server is only visible to and
                manageable by the system. Existing or updated
                attributes on a load balancer with SSL Termination
                will also apply to its shadow server. For example, if
                Connection Logging is enabled on an SSL load balancer,
                it will also be enabled on the shadow server and Cloud
                Files logs will contain log files for both. </para>

                        line feed characters should be wrapped in a

                        file, JSON will not properly handle the field.
                        The key/certificates can be wrapped in a
                        newline character in Java, for example, using
