Persistent connections
======================

By default, the API supports persistent connections via `HTTP/1.1`
keepalives. All connections are kept alive unless the connection header
is set to close.

To prevent abuse, HTTP sessions have a timeout of 30 seconds before
being closed.

.. note::
    The server may close the connection at any time and clients should not rely on this behavior.
