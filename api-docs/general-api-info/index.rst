General API information
=======================

Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. See the API Operations chapter for details about specific operations.

The Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers API is implemented using a ReSTful web service interface. Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the load balancing service shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products and services.

.. note:: 
    All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using HTTPS on TCP port 443.
