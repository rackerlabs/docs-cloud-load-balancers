Paginated collections
=====================

To reduce load on the service, list operations return a maximum limit of 100 items at a 
time. This is referred to as *pagination*. If a request supplies no limit or one that 
exceeds the configured default limit, the default is used instead.

Pagination provides the ability to limit the size of the returned data as well as 
retrieve a specified subset of a large data set. Pagination has two key concepts:
limit and marker. *Limit* is the restriction on the maximum number of items for that 
type that can be returned. *Marker* is a reference to an object's id and is in the list
of paged results at that particular resource. In this case, the resource is a 
load balancer, so the marker is the load balancer id at which to begin the list of the 
paged results. To navigate the collection, the ``limit`` and ``marker`` parameters can 
be set in the URI. For example, ``?limit=10&marker=1234`` displays a maximum of 10 
load balancers in the paginated results, beginning with the load balancer whose id is 
1234.

There is also an ``offset`` parameter that can be used as a count of the number of 
objects from where the paginated list is started.

If a marker beyond the end of a list is given, an empty list is returned. Note that 
list operations never return 404 (itemNotFound) faults.
