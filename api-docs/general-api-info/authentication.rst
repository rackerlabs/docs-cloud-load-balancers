Every ReST request against the Load Balancers Service requires the inclusion of a 
specific authorization token, supplied in the ``X-Auth-Token`` HTTP header of each API

credentials to the following Rackspace Cloud Identity API service endpoint:

.. code::

       https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0
