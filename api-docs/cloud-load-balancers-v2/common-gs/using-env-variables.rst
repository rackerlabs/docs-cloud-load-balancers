..  note::
		The environment variables created with the ``export`` command are
		valid only for the current terminal session. If you start a new session,
		you must run the ``export`` commands again. To reuse the variables across
		sessions, update the configuration file for your shell environment to
		include the ``export`` statements. For details about using and managing
		environment variables on different systems, see the
		`Environment variables wiki`_.
