Creating Cloud Servers
=========================

In this section you create two new Cloud Servers (or use two
existing Cloud Servers) to set up as nodes for your load balancer.

.. note::
   If you are using existing Cloud Servers on your account, skip Steps 1-5
   and go directly to Step 6 below.

Create a Cloud Server using the Cloud Servers section of the Cloud
Control Panel (login here: `Cloud Control
Panel <http://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__).

.. note::
   You can also create a Cloud Server using the Cloud Servers API. Refer to
   the `Cloud Servers API Developer Guide <http://developer.rackspace.com/>`__
   for details.
