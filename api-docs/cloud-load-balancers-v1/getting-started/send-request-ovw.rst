Sending API requests
----------------------------------------------

This section shows how to send requests by using cURL.

.. note::
     You can also use Rackspace Cloud API services by using the following methods:

     -  If you are developing applications or automation, try using `Rackspace SDKs`_, the
        `Rackspace CLI`_, or `OpenStack client applications`_.

     -  For API development, testing and workflow management in a graphical environment, try
        interacting with the API by using an application such as
        `Postman`_  or `RESTClient for Firefox`_.
