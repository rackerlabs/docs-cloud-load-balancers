Authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud
-------------------------------------

Whether you use cURL, a REST client, or a command line client (CLI) to send requests
to the |apiservice|, you need an authentication token to include in the ``X-Auth-Token``
header of each API request.

With a valid token, you can send API requests to any of the API service endpoints that you
are authorized to use. The authentication response includes a token expiration date. When a token
expires, you can send another authentication request to get a new one.


.. note::
     For more information about authentication tokens, see the following topics in the
     Rackspace Cloud Identity developer documentation.

     - :rax-devdocs:`Authentication token operations <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/token-operations>`

        The examples in the Getting Started Guide show how to authenticate by
        using username and API key credentials,
        which is a more secure way to communicate with API services.
        The authentication token operations reference describes other types of
        credentials that you can use for authentication.
