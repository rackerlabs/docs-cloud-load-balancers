Creating Cloud Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you create two new Cloud Servers (or use two
existing Cloud Servers) to set up as nodes for your load balancer.

   If you are using existing Cloud Servers on your account, skip Steps 1-5
   and go directly to Step 6 below.

Create a Cloud Server using the Cloud Servers section of the Cloud
Control Panel (login here: `Cloud Control
