Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


All load balancers utilize an algorithm that defines how traffic should
be directed between back-end nodes. The default algorithm for newly
created load balancers is ``RANDOM``, which can be overridden at
creation time or changed after the load balancer has been initially
provisioned. The algorithm name is to be constant within a major
revision of the load balancing API, though new algorithms may be created
with a unique algorithm name within a given major revision of the
service API.

| Name                         | Description                                                       |
+==============================+===================================================================+
| ``LEAST_CONNECTIONS``        | The node with the lowest number of connections receives requests. |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``RANDOM``                   | Back-end servers are selected at random.                          |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``ROUND_ROBIN``              | Connections are routed to each of the back-end servers in turn.   |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``WEIGHTED_LEAST_CONNECTIONS``| Each request is assigned to a node based on the number of         |
|                              | concurrent connections to the node and its weight.                |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN``     |  A round robin algorithm, but with different proportions of       |
|                              |  traffic beingdirected to the back-end nodes. Weights must be     |
|                              |  defined as part  of the load balancer's node configuration.      |
