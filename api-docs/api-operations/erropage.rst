Error pagesÂ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


An error page is the HTML file that is shown to an end user who
is attempting to access a load balancer node that is
offline/unavailable.

During provisioning, every load balancer is configured with a default
error page that gets displayed when traffic is requested for an offline
node.

You can add a single custom error page with an HTTP-based protocol to a
load balancer. Page updates override existing content. If a custom error
page is deleted, or the load balancer is changed to a non-HTTP protocol,
the default error page is restored.
