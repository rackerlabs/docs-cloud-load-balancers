Load balancers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Users can configure all documented features of the load balancer at
creation time by simply providing the additional elements or attributes
in the request. This document provides an overview of all the features
the load balancing service supports.

Any protocol that is not listed in the protocols response, or is in the
list but port=0, requires port to be set. For example the TCP protocol
is in the list, however it specifies port as 0
(``<protocol name="TCP" port="0" />``), therefore it
requires port to be set.

You must specify the type of virtualIp to add along with the creation of
a load balancer. The following table describes the options.

Table. Virtual IP types

+---------------+------------+-----------------+
| Version       | Type       | Outcome         |
+===============+============+=================+
| Not Specified | PUBLIC     | IPV4 & IPV6     |
+---------------+------------+-----------------+
| IPV4          | PUBLIC     | IPV4            |
+---------------+------------+-----------------+
| IPV6          | PUBLIC     | IPV6            |
+---------------+------------+-----------------+
| Not Specified | SERVICENET | IPV4            |
+---------------+------------+-----------------+
| IPV4          | SERVICENET | IPV4            |
+---------------+------------+-----------------+
| IPV6          | SERVICENET | Failure Message |

Notice in the following examples that API users are now able to
programmatically derive the source IP addresses of our load balancers
using the ``sourceAddresses`` label included at the bottom of the create
load balancer (required attributes) response. This feature is useful for
customers who are automating the deployment of infrastructure and must
determine the IP addresses of requests coming from our load balancers
for the purpose of creating more robust firewall rules.

To conserve IPv4 address space, Rackspace highly recommends sharing
Virtual IPs between your load balancers. If you have at least one load
balancer, you may create subsequent load balancers that share a single
virtual IPv4 and/or a single IPv6 by issuing a **POST** and supplying a
virtual IP ID instead of a type. Additionally, this feature is highly
desirable if you wish to load balance both an unsecured and secure
protocol using one IP or DNS name. For example, this methods makes it
possible to use the same load balancing configuration to support
``HTTP`` and ``HTTPS``.

..  note:: 

       -  Load balancers sharing a virtual IP *must* utilize a unique port.
          Also, to share both an IPv4 as well as an IPv6, you must supply an
          extra ``virtualIp`` object to the ``virtualIps`` container with the
          desired ``ID`` being shared.

       -  In addition, load balancers sharing Virtual IPs can utilize
          certain-compatible TCP/UDP and DNS based protocols on the same port.
          See :ref:`compatible-shared-load-balancing-protocols` 
          for more details.

All load balancers also have a status attribute that shows current
configuration status of the device. This status is immutable by the
caller and is updated automatically based on state changes within the
service. When a load balancer is first created, it is placed into a
``BUILD`` status while the configuration is being generated and applied
based on the request. Once the configuration is applied and finalized,
it is in an ``ACTIVE`` status. In the event of a configuration change or
update, the status of the load balancer changes to ``PENDING_UPDATE`` to
signify configuration changes are in progress but are not yet been
finalized. Load balancers in a ``SUSPENDED`` status are configured to
reject traffic and does not forward requests to back-end nodes.

Table. Load balancer statuses

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name            | Description                                                         |
+=================+=====================================================================+
| ACTIVE          | Load balancer is configured properly and ready to |                 | 
|                 | serve traffic to incoming requests via the configured virtual IPs.  |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| BUILD           | Load balancer is being provisioned for the first time and           |
|                 | configuration is being applied to bring the service online. The     |
|                 | service cannot yet serve incoming requests.                         |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PENDING_UPDATE  | Load balancer is online but configuration changes are being         |
|                 | applied to update the service based on a previous request.          |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PENDING_DELETE  | Load balancer is online but configuration changes are being         |
|                 | applied to begin deletion of the service based on a                 |
|                 | previous request.                                                   |         
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SUSPENDED       | Load balancer has been taken offline and disabled; contact Support. | 
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ERROR           | The system encountered an error when attempting to configure the    |
|                 | load balancer; contact Support.                                     |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DELETED         | Load balancers in DELETED status can be displayed for at least 90   |
|                 | days after deletion.                                                |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

The update operation allows the caller to change one or more of the
following attributes:

-  ``name``

-  ``algorithm``

-  ``protocol``

-  ``halfClosed``

-  ``port``

-  ``timeout``

-  ``httpsRedirect``
