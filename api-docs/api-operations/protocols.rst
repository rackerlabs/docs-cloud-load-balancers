Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


All load balancers must define the protocol of the service which is
being load balanced. The protocol selection should be based on the
protocol of the back-end nodes. When configuring a load balancer, the
default port for the given protocol is selected unless otherwise
specified.

..  note:: 

       -  UDP-Based protocols (DNS\_UDP, UDP, and UDP\_STREAM) have the
          following limitations:

          -  They are not capable of using the Health Monitor features.

          -  Also, SSL Termination is unavailable when using UDP-based ports.

       -  Changing the protocol or port for a load balancer will disable
          session persistence.

| Name           | Description                                                         |
+================+=====================================================================+
| ``DNS_TCP``    | This protocol works with IPv6 and allows your DNS server to receive |
|                | traffic using TCP port 53.                                          |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``DNS_UDP``    | This protocol works with IPv6 and allows your DNS server to receive |
|                | traffic using UDP port 53.                                          |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``FTP``        | The File Transfer Protocol defines how files are transported over   |
|                | the Internet. It is typically used when downloading or uploading    |
|                | files to or from web servers.                                       |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``HTTP``       | The Hypertext Transfer Protocol defines how communications occur    |
|                | on the Internet between clients and web servers. For example, if    |
|                | you request a web page in your browser, HTTP defines how the web    |
|                | server fetches the page and returns it your browser.                |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``HTTPS``      | The Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer (SSL)      |
|                | provides encrypted communication over the Internet. It securely     |
|                | verifies the authenticity of the web server you are communicating   |
|                | with.                                                               |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``IMAPS``      | The Internet Message Application Protocol over Secure Socket Layer  |
|                | (SSL) defines how an email client, such as Microsoft Outlook,       |
|                | retrieves and transfers email messages with a mail server.          |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``IMAPv2``     | Version 2 of IMAPS.                                                 | 
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``IMAPv3``     | Version 3 of IMAPS.                                                 | 
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``IMAPv4``     | Version 4, the current version of IMAPS.                            | 
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``LDAP``       | The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol provides access to        |
|                | distributed directory information services over the Internet. This  |
|                | protocol is typically used to access a large set of hierarchical    |
|                | records, such as corporate email or a telephone directory.          |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``LDAPS``      | The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over Secure Socket Layer  |
|                | (SSL).                                                              |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``MYSQL``      | This protocol allows communication with MySQL, an open source       |
|                | database management system.                                         |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``POP3``       | The Post Office Protocol is one of the two most common protocols    |
|                | for communication between email clients and email servers.          |
|                | Version 3 is the current standard of POP.                           |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``POP3S``      | Post Office Protocol over Secure Socket Layer.                      |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``SFTP``       | The SSH File Transfer Protocol is a secure file transfer and        |
|                | management protocol. This protocol assumes the files are using a    |
|                | secure channel, such as SSH, and that the identity of the client    |
|                | is available to the protocol.                                       |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``SMTP``       | The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used by electronic mail        |
|                | servers to send and receive email messages. Email clients use this  |
|                | protocol to relay messages to another computer or web server, but   |
|                | use IMAP or POP to send and receive messages.                       |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``TCP``        | The Transmission Control Protocol is a part of the Transport Layer  |
|                | protocol and is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol  |
|                | Suite. It provides a reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of      |
|                | bytes from one program on a computer to another program on another  |
|                | computer. Applications that require an ordered and reliable         |
|                | delivery of packets use this protocol.                              |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``TCP_CLIE``    | This protocol is similar to TCP, but is more efficient when a       |
|``(TCP_CLIENT_``| client is expected to write the data first.                         |
|``FIRST)``      |                                                                     |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``TCP_STREAM`` | TCP Streaming allows either the client or server to send the first  |
|                | message when a connection is established. This option is for        |
|                | protocols where there is no request-response semantic. Either side  |
|                | of the connection can write the first message, with no response     |
|                | being necessarily required or expected.                             |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``UDP``        | The User Datagram Protocol provides a datagram service that         |
|                | emphasizes speed over reliability, It works well with applications  |
|                | that provide security through other measures.                       |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``UDP_STRE``    | This protocol is designed to stream media over networks and is      |
|``(UDP_STREAM)``| built on top of UDP.                                                |
