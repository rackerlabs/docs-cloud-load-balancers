==========================
Request and response types
==========================

The Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers API supports both the JSON and XML data serialization formats. The request format is specified using the ``Content-Type`` header and is required for operations that have a request body. The response format can be specified in requests using either the ``Accept`` header or adding an ``.xml`` or ``.json`` extension to the request URI. Note that it is possible for a response to be serialized using a format different from the request. If no response format is specified, JSON is the default. If conflicting formats are specified using both an ``Accept`` header and a query extension, the query extension takes precedence.

Some operations support an Atom representation that can be used to efficiently determine when the state of services has changed.
