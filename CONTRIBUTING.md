##Project description
<!-- Provide as little or as much information about architecture as needed to help 
contributors figure out which file to update.-->

This project is developed and built by using the 
[Python Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Content is 
written in [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html), which is the markup syntax and 
parser component of [Python Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/index.html).

Source files for the Sphinx documentation project are in the ``api-docs`` directory. 
Following are the key files that define project and content architecture: 

**Cloud Load Balancers v1**

# Submitting changes

When you've completed your changes, submit a pull request. Someone on the Information Development team will review your PR.
- Minor updates and corrections get a quick review to ensure that content is error-free and doesn't introduce other issues.
- More complex changes or additions require both technical and editorial review. 

Depending on the review feedback, you might be asked to make additional changes. 

After content has been reviewed and approved, the updates can be merged to the master branch. The merge triggers the build and 
deploy process. Typically, new content is available on developer.rackspace.com within a minute or two after it is merged. Larger 
updates might take a bit longer.

## Previewing changes

When you submit a pull request, the Strider build process creates a preview of your changes in a staging environment. 
After the build process completes, the following message displays in the pull request comments with a link to the content: ``Your content preview is now ready.``

You can also build the project locally using the [Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/). For details, see 
[Building from source](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/doc/tools/build-from-source.rst).
